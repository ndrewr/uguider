		<h3>about this thing</h3>
		<p>U-guider aggregates nanodegree-relevant links from multiple sources.</p>

		<p>Each link gets it's own Click Counter so we know how many others have already visited and can direct our attention accordingly. The master post list is ranked by date added and heart rank. Ah yes about that...</p>

		<p>There is a crude ranking system using hearts. The idea is to direct attention to particularly interesting links. All new links start with 2 hearts. NOTE: the same person can't adjust rank on the same post twice in a row.</p>

		<p>Ranking and creating new posts are super-powers reserved for highly exclusive 'Logged-In Members'. How to obtain this revered status? Login with LinkedIn.</p>
