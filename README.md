#U-Guider
===============================================================
Aggregates links from various sources based on configured criteria. Logged-in users can post new links.

Each link has an associated Click Counter to alert Users to how many other Users have
already followed that link. This is meant to free User to visit less trafficked links.

Each post also carries a basic ranking system represented by hearts. More hearts floats to the top, zero hearts sink to the bottom. The same User cannot rank the same post (up or down) twice in a row.


#Link Sources
===============================================================
Currently checks Reddit hourly for the query:

q=udacity+nano*&restrict_sr=off&sort=new&t=all&limit=10
